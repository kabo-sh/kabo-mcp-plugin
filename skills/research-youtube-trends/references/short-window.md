# Short window: hottest and fastest-rising

Read this whole file before the first call of this route. `<run directory>` and
`<skill directory>` are the absolute paths from *Running commands* in `SKILL.md`; run every command
from the run directory.

Use this route when the requested window is seven days or shorter (the last day, the last 48
hours, this week — named in any language) and the user wants recent hot videos to copy. Every
longer window, and every ask for repeated mechanisms or account-relative multiples, uses the
video-trend workflow with its window policies. Do **not** stop because the short-window pool is
thin. Do **not** create a query plan, Snapshot, Analyzer output or `TrendResearchReport`. Do
**not** call `collect_youtube_trend_candidates` or `enrich_youtube_shortlist`, not even to fill
plays: a collection on a short-window ask is a failed delivery, not a reason to stop.

## Collect

First read `references/short-window-topic-gate.md` and freeze its request context before retrieval.

1. Readiness: `youtube-public/search_videos` and `youtube-public/get_video` implemented and ready.
2. Freeze the requested window in UTC: `until` is now unless the user named an end, and `since` is
   `until` minus the requested span (resolve a relative span once against the current time). At
   most two intents from the user's niche.
3. Make one `collect_youtube_recent_videos` call. It runs every search, deduplicates the video ids
   and reads their public plays with `get_video` in chunks of 50. Its `queries`, in this order:
   - Window lane: for each intent, `{"q": "<intent phrase>", "published_after": "<since>",
     "published_before": "<until>"}`, the exact frozen window.
   - Heat lane: for each intent, `{"q": "<intent phrase>", "published_after": "<until minus 30
     days>", "published_before": "<until>", "order": "viewCount"}`.

   Add `"delivery": "download"`. If the connected tool schema exposes `include_content_signals`, set
   it to `true` so the same detail calls return declared audio-language evidence. If `queries[].language`
   is available, use the query's planned approved language as its YouTube language code
   (for example `en`, `es`, `zh-Hans` or `zh-Hant`), as a relevance preference, never a hard filter.
   A single-language scope uses that language on every query. For an approved multilingual or
   unrestricted search, spread the two subject-and-use intents across the chosen search languages,
   keeping each intent's language on both its window and heat query. State which languages this
   bounded search covered; never apply the account's original language to every translated query.
   If no language preference is supported or applicable to a query, omit it. Older tools
   may lack these optional inputs: omit them, keep the local language gate, and report missing audio
   evidence. Leave every other argument at its default. Do not save the result and never call
   `get_research_data_download` yourself: its result id, the 22 characters between
   `research-export/v1/` and `.json` in its download url, is all `place` needs. Only a result with
   no download url is saved whole, as returned, to
   `<run directory>/host-results/01-collect_youtube_recent_videos.json` (with the host's file-write
   ability, never as a command-line argument), and `--id` is left out.

4. Place and merge it with the frozen window right away (`place` fetches the result itself; ids
   expire in 10 minutes):

   ```bash
   cd '<run directory>' && python3 '<skill directory>/scripts/complete_youtube_short_window.py' place --id=<result id> --since <since> --until <until> --output short-window-input.json
   ```

   It writes each search and each `get_video` chunk as its own envelope file and merges them into
   `short-window-input.json`; never write an envelope yourself. Search rows have no `statistics`;
   plays come only from `get_video`, and null plays are never zero. It refuses a collection in which
   any search or `get_video` chunk failed, did not run or did not complete, and one whose
   `get_video` filled no plays: then the short-window report cannot be completed: say so and stop,
   and never call again or build from the remaining lanes.

## Build and author

Complete the projection and every topic decision in `references/short-window-topic-gate.md` first.

5. Build the layers and print the presentation contract:

```bash
cd '<run directory>' && KABO_STATIC_RUN_DIR='<run directory>' python3 '<skill directory>/scripts/build_short_window_layers.py' short-window-input.json --topic-gate-input short-window-topic-input.json --topic-decisions short-window-topic-decisions.json --output short-window-layers.json
cd '<run directory>' && KABO_STATIC_RUN_DIR='<run directory>' python3 '<skill directory>/scripts/render_short_window_report.py' short-window-layers.json --language <the user's chat language> --print-presentation-contract --text-only --contract-output short-window-presentation.json
```

The build makes two layers: the heat layer (hottest dated videos of the last 30 days) and the
window layer (the exact window). Heat rows must show numeric public plays, author names and their
publish time, and must not be described as in-window. An empty window layer is a valid
deliverable.

The print command prints the full source contract and creates a smaller, text-only presentation
file. Read the whole contract without truncation. Translate the printed sources into the user's
chat language by filling **only** every `text` field in `short-window-presentation.json`, including
labels, limitations and every displayed source excerpt; keep proper names where appropriate.

- Preserve each complete source excerpt's meaning, numeric facts, URLs and handles. A row's
  `source_excerpt` is the first 80 characters of its caption and may stop mid-word: translate
  exactly that excerpt, not the full caption in `short-window-layers.json`, and never restore
  numbers, links, handles or words cut off after it. Empty source excerpts stay empty.
- The original literal-number comparison remains first in every language. Only when those numeric
  spellings differ, a complete English month-name calendar date may use the equivalent Chinese
  year/month/day notation (or vice versa); preserve the same valid date. This fallback does not
  verify translation semantics. Other numbers remain literal: do not add numbers from the
  surrounding task or window.
- Do not summarize the excerpt, add a headline, invent viewing, acceleration or broader coverage,
  or add advice.
- Keep the generated layers hash, row slots and language unchanged. Do not copy source excerpts or
  item hashes into this file: the renderer binds those immutable fields from the exact layers
  bytes. Do not change the raw layers. The older full presentation contract remains accepted with
  all its binding checks.
- A script can check the binding and literal facts, not translation faithfulness; read the final
  complete report to verify its language and meaning.

The print mode only creates the presentation skeleton and is not a final step. Keep the same run
directory for every step and never resend accumulated inputs or layers.

## Render

Render the authored presentation in the same run:

```bash
cd '<run directory>' && KABO_STATIC_RUN_DIR='<run directory>' python3 '<skill directory>/scripts/render_short_window_report.py' short-window-layers.json creator-report.md --language <the user's chat language> --presentation short-window-presentation.json --allow-authoring-correction
```

The renderer checks the complete layers, presentation structure and immutable bindings before
classifying authored prose. Only named text errors return `status: needs_correction` with exit 0,
the exact canonical sources and the same-run `next_stage` arguments. This is unfinished authoring,
not an `ok` report: it writes no report, and an older report is not approved for delivery. Make
**one bounded correction** to only the named `text` fields against those sources, then repeat that
stage once in this same run. If it still needs correction, state the unfinished translation and
stop; do not keep rewriting, refetch, change layers or hashes, reserve a replacement run or deliver
the old English output. Source, structure, binding, file and internal errors remain failures. The
command without `--allow-authoring-correction` stays strict, and the form without a presentation
is legacy output, not a language-complete report.

## Final check

Only after render returns `status: ok`, run this route's final step, the strict read-only report
check:

```bash
cd '<run directory>' && KABO_STATIC_RUN_DIR='<run directory>' python3 '<skill directory>/scripts/render_short_window_report.py' short-window-layers.json creator-report.md --language <the user's chat language> --presentation short-window-presentation.json --verify-report
```

It recomputes the original strict validation and requires the existing report bytes to match
exactly; it never creates or rewrites a report. No connector call, new run or extra evidence is
needed. Do not emit, return or claim success from the rendered file until this final step
succeeds; then deliver `creator-report.md` after the complete-report language check in `SKILL.md`
(*Language at delivery*).
