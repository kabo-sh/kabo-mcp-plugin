"""The mechanical half of a skill driver: hand calls over, place responses, run scripts.

A skill's `drive.py` runs everything between two model judgments — which connector call follows, where
each response is placed, which deterministic script runs next — and prints only what the next judgment
reads. This module is the part of that which does not depend on the skill: fetch rounds recorded by
what they asked for, the hand-over of each round to the model as named public MCP tool calls
(`--placed` picks the staged responses up), one more hand-over of a round the data service briefly
failed, the run directory, the stage lock and the stage state file.

Where a stage runs. Every stage works in the run directory `static_host.py init` reserved for this
request (`KABO_STATIC_RUN_DIR`). Every stage after the first runs only from inside it: from anywhere
else — this skill's own directory above all — it stops before writing anything and names the
directory to `cd` into. One stage at a time holds a run directory (`.drive.lock`), and the state file
is replaced whole, never rewritten in place.
