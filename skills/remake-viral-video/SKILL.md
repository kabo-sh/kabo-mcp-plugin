# Remake Viral Video

Kabo's hosted runner does every deterministic step of a remake: analysis of the reference and the
creator's footage, speech, first frames, talking video, grading, captions, review and delivery. You
make the creative calls at one point only, the script, and keep the user informed. Everything runs
through `start_remake_video`, `get_remake_video` and `render_remake_video`. If those tools are not
available on this connection, say that video remakes are not available here and stop; never draw,
record or assemble a video another way.

A remake takes about half an hour, most of it waiting on the runner. When the host supports one,
run this Skill in a foreground sub-agent and wait for its final result before replying; never run
it in the background and tell the user the video will come later. Without a foreground sub-agent,
follow the same steps in the main thread.

## What this covers

- A reference of **60 seconds or less** where **one person talks to the camera** for most of the
  video, at any distance, seated or standing, anywhere, with a fixed or slightly handheld camera.
  This version remakes only this talking-head kind. References that cut to screen recordings or to
  a product the speaker shows, and voice-over references, are not remade yet.
- Refused by the runner before any video is generated (`out_of_scope`): references over 60
  seconds, walking, vehicle or first-person vlogs where the camera keeps moving, dialogues between
  several people, references with nobody speaking on camera, references where the speaker is on
  camera less than about half the time, and references that are mostly other footage. So are
  creator videos with no clear frontal view of the creator's face.
- The creator is framed as the reference frames its speaker, shot by shot; the reference's other
  shots (cutaways, inserts, other people) are reused from its own footage. The reference's speaker
  never appears in the result.
- One method: the reference's content and setting are kept and the creator is placed into it
  (route B). Four kinds of line are rewritten in the creator's voice (the opening, the original
  author's claims about themselves, one closing summary and the call to action); the rest of the
  reference's lines are kept, or dropped with a reason. The whole face is generated, so likeness is
  lower than real footage of the creator.
- The final video has no on-screen label, notice or watermark. Never say it carries one.
- Only the model that makes the talking footage can be chosen, and only from the options
  `get_remake_video` returns once the script gate is reached (step 6). Voice, images and editing
  use one fixed production setup. If the user asks for any other model (for example Veo, HeyGen or
  ElevenLabs), say in one line that the talking footage can be made with one of the offered
  options only and the rest cannot be changed, then carry on.

## Set up one run

`<skill directory>` is the folder holding this `SKILL.md`. Reserve exactly one run per remake:

```sh
python3 '<skill directory>/scripts/static_host.py' init --workspace '<user-workspace>'
```

It prints the run directory. Run every later command from it with `KABO_STATIC_RUN_DIR` set to it,
in the same command (`cd '<run directory>' && KABO_STATIC_RUN_DIR='<run directory>' python3 ...`):
many hosts do not keep environment variables or the working directory between commands. Paths such
as `host-results/...`, `brief/...` and `script/...` are relative to the run directory; `scripts/...`
and `references/...` live in `<skill directory>` and are called by that absolute path. Quote
filesystem paths in commands. Every command below is complete as written: do not run a script
with `--help`, read its source or search other Skills.

**Saving a tool result.** When a step says to save a result, write the complete
`get_remake_video` or `render_remake_video` result (the host's result export, or the result
unchanged) to `host-results/<NN>-<tool name>.json`, numbered in call order. These results are
small: they carry download links, never the brief or the video itself. Never retype the brief or
rebuild a file from what was displayed.

## 1. Collect the inputs

The first time the user asks for a remake in a conversation, say in two or three sentences, before
asking for anything or starting, all three of these:

- what this remakes: a reference of 60 seconds or less where one person talks to the camera;
- that references outside this (dialogues between several people, walking or travel vlogs, nobody
  speaking on camera, over 60 seconds; for now also screen-recording, product-showing and
  voice-over videos) are refused before anything is generated, and a refusal is not charged;
- that borderline references may not come out well.

Say it once per conversation, also
when the first message already has both inputs: it is information, not a question, so start right
after it.

A remake needs both of these. Check them before any paid call:

1. **One reference video**: the viral video to remake, as a YouTube or Instagram link, 60 seconds
   or less, one person talking to camera.
2. **The creator's own talking footage**, separate from the reference: their Instagram handle or
   profile link, or one to four YouTube or Instagram links to videos where they talk to camera. It
   decides how much the result looks like the creator.

These two inputs are all a remake needs. When both are present, start: do not add checks of your
own. In particular, do not look up connected accounts, social or OAuth connection status, creator
profiles or any other Kabo workspace data, and do not ask the user to grant extra Kabo permissions;
none of that is part of a remake, and a missing workspace permission is not a reason to wait. The
user's right to use the creator's face and voice is the single `rights` line written at the script
gate (step 4), not a stop before it.

Uploaded or local video files are not supported in this version, and neither are TikTok links:
say so and ask for a YouTube or Instagram link instead. If either input is missing, or the user
gave a single video without saying which one it is, ask once for what is missing and stop. Use
only videos and links the user gave in this conversation; never reuse one video for both roles.
If a length you can see (the user states it) is over 60 seconds, say references are limited to 60
seconds and ask for a shorter one.

Whenever you stop before `start_remake_video` has accepted the job (something is missing, a video
is refused, the inputs are refused), tell the user that no remake was started, no remake fee was
charged and it does not count toward the daily remake limit. Fetching the videos may still have used
the daily data allowance; do not claim that nothing at all was used.

`--creator-name` is a short ASCII name for the creator (letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`). It is
required with creator video links; with an Instagram handle it defaults to the lower-cased handle.
When the user gave video links and no name, use the name they go by in the conversation, or ask
for one together with any other missing input. Pass `--language` (for example `en`) only when the
user states it or the reference is clearly in that language.

## 2. Start the job and wait for the script gate

Before the first paid call, tell the user in one or two sentences what will happen: the method
above and that it takes about half an hour in total (do not say the result carries a label or
mark). Do not wait for a reply unless the user asked to approve first. Then build the arguments:

```sh
cd '<run directory>' && KABO_STATIC_RUN_DIR='<run directory>' python3 '<skill directory>/scripts/static_host.py' start-call --reference-url '<reference link>' --instagram-handle '<handle or profile link>'
```

For creator video links, pass `--creator-video '<link>'` once per link (one to four) instead of
`--instagram-handle`, and add `--creator-name '<name>'` (required then). Add `--language '<code>'`
only as step 1 says.

It checks the links and prints `{"tool": "start_remake_video", "arguments": {...}}`. Call
`start_remake_video` with exactly those arguments. A refusal from the script is an input problem:
relay it and ask for a corrected input; nothing was started.

- The `idempotency_key` is stable for the same inputs in this run. On a timeout or lost response,
  call again with exactly the same arguments; the key returns the same job instead of creating and
  charging another. Never create a second job for the same request.
- `fetching_inputs` means the videos are still being fetched (`job_id` is null). Tell the user
  `message` in one line, then call `start_remake_video` again with the same arguments after
  `retry_after_s` seconds (wait with the host's own sleep or wait facility); the same fetches are
  picked up.
- A tool error carries `code`, `message` and `retryable`. No remake was started by any of them;
  relay `message` in plain words:
  - `validation_error` (a link or handle that cannot be used, a reference over 60 seconds, a video
    that cannot be fetched, no usable reels, the same video in both roles): no remake fee was charged
    and the daily remake limit was not used. Ask for a different input instead of resubmitting.
  - `quota_exceeded` with `retryable: false`: the daily remake limit (or the daily data allowance)
    is reached. Say no new remake was started and another can start tomorrow.
  - `quota_exceeded` with `retryable: true`: another remake is still running. Say one remake runs
    at a time and offer to start this one when it finishes.
  - `conflict`: this key was already used with different inputs. Build the arguments again with
    `--attempt 2` (then 3, ...) and call again.
  - `subscription_required`: a remake needs a Kabo Pro subscription; say so.
  - `service_unavailable` with `retryable: false`: Kabo could not fetch the videos on its side; no
    remake was started. Do not retry with the same key. Say so; if the user wants to try again later,
    build the arguments again with the next `--attempt` and call once.
  - `service_unavailable` or another error with `retryable: true`: try once more after a minute; if
    it fails again, say remakes are unavailable right now.

Once there is a `job_id`, call `get_remake_video` with `{"job_id": "<id>", "wait_s": 30}` until the
status is no longer `preparing`. Analysis takes about ten minutes. Tell the user the current stage
in one line when it changes; do not repeat yourself on every call.

**Talking head only.** Stop as soon as a result shows `failure: "unsupported_type"` (the status
stays `waiting_script`, and `brief`, `talking_models` and `gate_message` are null), or a
`reference_type` that is set and is not `talking`. Say that this version of the plugin only remakes
pure talking-head videos (one person talking to the camera, without cutting to screen recordings,
without showing or handling an object or product for much of the video, and not voice-over); a
speaker who faces the camera throughout can still be one of these kinds. Give `failure_reason` in
plain words. It names the kind Kabo detected and says Kabo web supports it: tell the user both, so
they know they can remake this video on Kabo web. Say that no video was generated, and give the
spend the result reports, if any. Do not say whether it counts toward the daily limit. Do
not call `render_remake_video`; this job is finished.

A final status at this point (`out_of_scope`, `failed`, `timed_out`) is handled as in step 8; when
it comes from `start_remake_video`, its reason is in `message`.

## 3. Save the brief

At `waiting_script` the result carries `brief.download`, `gate_message` and `talking_models`.
Save the result as above, then fetch the brief at once (the link is short-lived):

```sh
cd '<run directory>' && KABO_STATIC_RUN_DIR='<run directory>' python3 '<skill directory>/scripts/static_host.py' fetch --input 'host-results/<NN>-get_remake_video.json'
```

It downloads the bundle, checks its host, size and sha256, and writes the four brief files under
`brief/work/`. When it says the link expired, the download was refused or the download is
unavailable, do what it prints: call `get_remake_video` again (that re-signs the link; nothing is
re-run), save that result and fetch again. For an unavailable download, wait about a minute before
calling again and stop after three tries; never call in a tight loop. If this host blocks scripts from the network, say that the remake cannot continue here; never
rebuild the brief from what was displayed.

## 4. Write the script (the only creative gate)

Read `references/script-gate.md` whole, then the references it names for the judgement in front of
you. In short:

- Proofread the reference's sentences and record it in the script as `proofread`.
- Keep the reference's lines word for word and in order; rewrite only the four slots, each with
  `slot`, `why`, `replaces` and `basis`; source every fact in a rewritten line to the creator's own
  lines or mark it as an inference; never invent the creator's experience.
- Keep the reference's on-screen title and numbered list; record every inherited element in the
  ledger, with a reason for each adapt or drop.
- Write the opening record with 2-3 candidates, and choose one yourself.
- Record your calls in the decisions record; nobody answers questions at this point.
- Write the plate and anchor prompts without describing the framing, holding the creator's hair
  and outfit exactly as in the identity references.

Write the four documents as `script/script.json`, `script/opening_review.json`,
`script/decisions.json` and `script/route_b_jobs.json` (a heredoc at the absolute path, or the
host's file tool).

## 5. Check the documents

```sh
cd '<run directory>' && KABO_STATIC_RUN_DIR='<run directory>' python3 '<skill directory>/scripts/check_documents.py' check
```

It prints `status` with `errors` and `warnings`. Fix every error in the document it names and run
it again; read each warning and change the document when it applies. Advance only on
`status: ready`. It checks structure only; the runner checks again when you submit.

## 6. Choose the talking model and render

Nothing is generated or charged before this step. Show the user the `talking_models` from the
waiting_script result, in their order, each with its label and its estimated cost (`est_usd`), and
say that the first one is the default. Do not add a recommendation of your own, drop options or
change the order. Unless the user already named a listed model (below), end your reply there and wait for the
answer; the job waits at the script gate.
When the conversation resumes, continue here in the same run directory.

- A model from the list, by number or name: use its `id`.
- A plain go-ahead with no choice ("OK", "yes", or the same in their language): the first option.
- The user already named one of the listed models earlier in this conversation (for example in the
  first request): use it without asking again. Tell them the model and its estimated cost, then
  render.
- A question about the options: answer it from the list, then wait for their choice.

Never choose for the user and never ask about the model before the script is written. Then build
the arguments (this repeats the check):

```sh
cd '<run directory>' && KABO_STATIC_RUN_DIR='<run directory>' python3 '<skill directory>/scripts/check_documents.py' render-args --talking-model '<id>' --models-from 'host-results/<NN>-get_remake_video.json'
```

It writes `render/render_remake_video.json`. Call `render_remake_video` with that file's content as
its arguments, unchanged. An accepted render returns `status: "running"`. A retry of an accepted
render returns the current state and never launches twice, so on a timeout or lost response call
it again with the same arguments. A `conflict` error with `retryable: true` means the job's brief
could not be read: call once more after a minute, then report it.
`quota_exceeded` with `retryable: true` from `render_remake_video` means another remake of this
account is still being prepared or rendered; one runs at a time. Nothing was started and the job
keeps waiting with its script: tell the user, wait for the other one (poll this job with
`get_remake_video` every few minutes, or let the user ask later) and call `render_remake_video` again
with the same arguments. A result with
`failure: "unsupported_type"` is handled as in step 2.

**The runner checks the documents first, after render returns.** If they fail, a later
`get_remake_video` shows `waiting_script` again, with `gate_message` (the runner's reason, for
example `cr check-script: ...`) and a fresh brief; nothing paid has been spent. Then:

1. Save that result and run `fetch` on it (step 3). It keeps the earlier brief as
   `brief.previous-<N>/` and writes the fresh one to `brief/`; your documents in `script/` stay.
2. Fix only what `gate_message` names, keep the rest of the documents as they were, and run step 5.
3. Build the arguments again with `--models-from` pointing at this newest result and the same
   talking model, and call `render_remake_video` again. Do not ask about the model again.

## 7. Production and delivery

Production takes about twenty minutes with the default model and longer with the others. Call
`get_remake_video` with `wait_s` 30 until the status is `delivered`, final, or `waiting_script`
again (the documents were rejected: step 6). While it is
`running`, report the stage in one line when it changes. Do not promise a finish time.

At `delivered`, save the result and fetch the video at once:

```sh
cd '<run directory>' && KABO_STATIC_RUN_DIR='<run directory>' python3 '<skill directory>/scripts/static_host.py' fetch --input 'host-results/<NN>-get_remake_video.json'
```

It checks the MP4's host, size and sha256 and prints its local `path`. An expired, refused or
unavailable download is handled as in step 3. Then tell the user:

- that the video is ready, with the local path (it carries no on-screen label or watermark: never
  say it does);
- what you rewrote and why, in two or three lines, and any inference line they should confirm
  before publishing;
- the spend the result reports (`spend_usd`), when present.

Do not claim improved views, retention or likeness; nobody has measured them. The result does not
report the outcome of Kabo's final quality review, so never say the video passed one; suggest the user
watch it in full before publishing.

## 8. When it does not finish

Every final status (`out_of_scope`, `failed`, `timed_out`) comes with `failure` and, when the
runner gave one, `failure_reason`. Always tell the user that reason in plain words, not only that
the remake was refused or stopped (for example: the reference is filmed with a camera that keeps
moving, like a walking or travel vlog, rather than one person talking to the camera). Do not quote
stage names or internal terms. Always say whether it was charged:

- `out_of_scope`: relay the reason. For a reference that is not a short talking-head video, suggest
  one of 60 seconds or less where one person speaks to the camera for most of it. When no clear
  frontal face of the creator was found, ask for links to videos where they talk facing the camera.
  Nothing was charged and the daily limit was not used; say so.
- `failed` with a likeness reason: the generated person did not look like the creator, so the video
  was stopped or not delivered. Say so plainly and ask for clearer footage of the creator facing the
  camera; do not resubmit the same inputs.
- `failed` or `timed_out`: say the remake did not finish, why, and that no video was produced. These
  jobs ran paid steps and count toward the daily limit; do not say otherwise. Do not resubmit on
  your own; offer to start a new remake if the user wants one.
- Any other `failure` value: relay `failure_reason` and the reported spend; do not guess whether it
  was charged.
- A `get_remake_video` call that fails: try once more; if it still fails, say the job is preserved
  and can be checked later with its job id. Never start a replacement job for an unknown outcome.

When the user's next step is outside this Skill, name the Skill that fits -- for example
`create-script-and-packaging` for a script only, or `analyze-content-video` for a teardown of the
reference -- without running it.
