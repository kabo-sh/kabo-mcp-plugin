# Adapt a source without losing the creative deliverable

Use this route for a request to turn an identified video into written clip
plans, opening variants or a carousel. A reference-only analysis remains an
analysis task; actual edited media needs a media execution capability from the
host, which this Skill does not provide.
Do not add source research to an independent creative brief.

Preserve the requested output, source identity, target platform, language and
requested quantity while obtaining evidence. A URL identifies source material;
it does not authorize inventing its contents or a native SelectedIdea.

## Obtain only the missing evidence

Reuse evidence already retrieved for this source in the conversation or the
workspace. For "latest", the channel's current upload listing and dates must be
checked before selecting the video (a `review-creator-account` run lists them);
a remembered URL or matching title is insufficient.

This Skill fetches no video evidence and runs no other Skill. If source content
is missing, name `analyze-content-video` for that URL as the next step, keep the
original creative request with packaging, and say what scope to ask it for: a
source-facts question (what this video actually says or demonstrates, its
ordered actions, named methods or tools, evidence anchors and unresolved gaps),
with timed anchors when the deliverable needs cut points. Its transcript export
or timestamped evidence answers that; the source URL identifies the evidence
target, not an instruction to explain why the video went viral. Reading this
skill does not itself enable a video tool.

The creative request and its secondary originality question are not part of
that scope: the video Skill is not asked to choose a new angle or write the
carousel. Once its output exists in the conversation or workspace, consume the
source facts and limitations within that output's own evidence-validation
limits. If it also contains a diagnosis, craft teardown or creative proposal,
those recommendations do not redefine the main task. Resume packaging with the
original request once evidence is sufficient, rather than relaying that report
as the final adaptation. Do not claim a retrieval failed if no retrieval was
attempted.

A missing transcript does not establish that visual evidence is unavailable.
If the video Skill can analyze this source and duration, it can obtain visual
observations without a transcript. Preserve the
evidence origin: when `frames.origin` is `model_observation`, describe the
observations as reported rather than directly seen. Paraphrase and attribute
`observations[].on_screen_text`; never present it as a verbatim source quote,
even if an upstream narrative suggests quoting it. An exact quotation needs
independently verifiable source text or a directly inspected source frame.
Do not invent speech from silent frames. When an analysis of this source is
already pending, wait for its output rather than suggesting another paid run.
Respect terminal errors recorded in that output. When no permitted path can
recover material facts needed for the adaptation, identify that specific gap
and ask for the minimum missing source material, preserving usable work.

## Return to the requested format

Once sufficient evidence is available, complete the adaptation in the same
task. A video-analysis summary, a plan to write later, or generic originality
advice alone is not the requested package.

Distinguish transferring source content from borrowing its format. When the
user asks to turn this video's content into another format, retain its central
subject, substantive takeaway and evidenced workflow or examples in the main
deliverable. A named method or tool may remain when it is part of what the
source teaches; describing its evidenced steps in new copy does not require
discarding the method. New framing and wording may change, but a viewer should still
learn the source's underlying content. Do not replace a demonstrated workflow
with a generic lesson about adapting content. Borrow only a hook or structure
for a different subject when the user actually requested that transfer.

Treat secondary requests about originality, attribution, tone or accessibility
as constraints or accompanying notes, not as a replacement topic. Before
delivering, compare the main pages or clips with the source subject and the
requested transformation; correct topic drift using the evidence already held.
This check needs no extra research, tool call or separate planning response.

- For a carousel, give each page's copy and visual direction, including the
  opening and ending. Add original framing or explanation while preserving
  source facts; distinguish proposed examples from observed events.
- For written clips, give the requested cut ranges, reasons, hooks and captions.
  Each cut boundary must be supported by timed transcript or visual evidence
  for the same video. Distinguish original-video times from a proposed edit's
  timing. Resolve conflicting timestamps before recommending precise cuts;
  untimed themes are only a partial result when the user requested cut points.
  Write timecodes as `mm:ss` or `hh:mm:ss`, with the seconds field below 60;
  do not imply millisecond precision from unreviewed automatic subtitles.
  Keep the recommended range consistent with the intended excerpt: do not
  include the next topic and then instruct the editor to remove it. When the
  exact sentence boundary is uncertain, mark that boundary as approximate
  and identify the source phrase to check instead of inventing a precise cut.
- For opening variants, retain the evidenced mechanism while delivering the
  requested new wording for the creator's subject, not a copy of the source.

Do not demand private performance metrics to draft an adaptation. Credit alone
does not establish permission, and new wording alone does not establish rights
to reuse footage. Do not invent a number of changes or percentage threshold
that guarantees originality or permission. Do not claim a rendered video,
image, approved package or
publication. If native package files were requested, use the existing selection,
validation and rendering contracts; this route does not replace those gates.
