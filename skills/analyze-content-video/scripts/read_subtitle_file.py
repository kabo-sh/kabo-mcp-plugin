"""Read a subtitle or text file the creator handed over, and turn it into cues.

A local cut has no platform captions to fetch, and this version of the Skill does not transcribe
audio. That leaves one tier between "the spoken track was read" and "it was not", and it is a good
one: a creator who cut with captions already has the file, and unlike anything a machine hears, the
wording in it is theirs. That is why the evidence records this origin separately -- it is what
licenses quoting a line as what the creator actually says.

What it is not is a measurement of the cut in front of us. A caption file can belong to an earlier
version, or to a different export entirely, and nothing here can tell. The timings are the file's
claim about the video, and the evidence says so beside them.

The refusals mirror the exporter's, because the same reasoning applies in the other direction:

**A file that parses to nothing is a failure, not an empty success.** An `.srt` with no readable
cue, or a `.txt` with no words, is reported with the reason. Recording it as `available` with an
empty cue list would put "this video says nothing" into the evidence when what happened is that a
file could not be read.

**The text is carried verbatim, inline tags included.** It is the creator's own file. Stripping
markup would be editing evidence to look tidier, and a caption that reads `<i>like this</i>` is
telling us something about how it was styled.

**`.vtt` is not advertised.** Its cue payload is close enough to SRT to half-work and different
enough to silently mangle positioning and voice spans, and a half-parsed subtitle file is worse
than a refused one.
