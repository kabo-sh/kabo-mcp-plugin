"""Render a CreatorTaskResult as the Markdown the creator reads.

This replaces a renderer that had drifted out of the delivery path. The old one built its own
document from the VideoAnalysis object with every heading hard-coded in English, which no
localized report could use; it was called by the package self-test and by nothing else, and the
reports that actually shipped were written by the model against `creator_view`. Rendering from
`creator_view` instead means the structured object and the visible document cannot disagree.

The section sequence is not a layout choice. It is the analysis frame projected outward — the
opening, then how the rest held, then what to change — and which sequence applies follows from
whose video it is. `validate_creator_shape.py` holds the object to that; this only presents it.

# Separating a position from a duration in prose the model wrote.
#
# A range is always a position: "0–3s" points at the opening even though both halves are bare
# integers, in any language. A lone figure is the hard case, and the rule used to be "a decimal
# point makes it a position" — which held only because the recorded runs were Chinese, where a
# duration is written with 秒 and never with `s`. In English a duration is written exactly like a
# position: "Cut every 2.5s" came out as "Cut every [0:02]", which says "at two seconds" about
# something that means "for two and a half".
#
# There is no wording-free way to tell the two apart, so the renderer stops guessing at the
# wording and reads the figure instead. A lone figure is a position when either holds:
#
#   * this result records that instant — the `evidence_index` entries carry `t_start_s` and
#     `t_end_s`, and each hook carries its own `time_range`; or
#   * it is written to a precision only a measurement has. Two or more decimal places comes off a
#     frame index or a transcript cue (`11.138s`, `12.88s`); a length a person writes carries one
#     at most ("every 2.5s", "the last 3s").
#
# Both halves are needed. The first alone leaves a real position the model mentioned but no
# evidence entry lists — and a frame-precision figure reaching the document is what
# `test_the_rendered_report_carries_no_raw_frame_times` exists to stop. The second alone would
# convert a duration someone happened to write as `2.50s`.
#
# The conversion happens here and not in `creator_view`, because the shape gate grounds every
# number in the prose against the numbers in the analysis: 15.207 is in the evidence and 15 is
# not, so a timecode written upstream would be rejected as an invented figure. The object keeps
# the precise seconds; the document shows the timecode.
