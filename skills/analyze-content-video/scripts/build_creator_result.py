"""Wrap the creator-facing view in the delivery envelope this run already knows how to fill.

The model used to write the envelope too: the version string, the result id, the task name, the
status, the identity block, the timestamp index and the follow-up list. Measured 2026-09-23, that
was about a quarter of a 5.9 KB object it spent 57 seconds typing, and none of it was a judgement
-- every value is either a constant, a copy of the request, or the timestamp of an observation the
analysis already carries. Three real runs wrote three different shapes of it, and two spellings of
`status` are on disk right now, because nothing checked a part nobody was reading.

What stays the model's is the reading -- the headline, summary, cards and next actions, in the
creator's language -- plus the decision and follow-up options. The source note is derived only from recorded
sampling and citation facts; an authored note never overrides those facts.
