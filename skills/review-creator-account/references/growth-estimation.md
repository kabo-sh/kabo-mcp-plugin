# Conditional growth calculations

Use `<skill directory>/scripts/estimate_growth.py` for a growth estimate, including a follow-up to a complete review. It has no network dependencies. Read actual persisted evidence or a user export; never manufacture observations. JSON retains the evidence rows; a Markdown handoff is saved beside it and printed. `computed` means arithmetic succeeded, not that future performance is known.

For a public review, `drive.py growth` replaces the two-step request below: run it in the review's run directory, choose one listed choice, save it as `review_growth_input.json` with the user's number and wording filled in, and run it again before writing the synthesis. `--metric` and `--horizon-days` follow the user's question (views, 30 days by default). Only `content_scenario` belongs in that file. `drive.py report` binds it to `snapshot.json`, `account_analysis.json` and the retained `question.txt`, recomputes the estimate, and includes the number, formula, observation ages, deadline comparison and sensitivity meaning in the validated `ACCOUNT_REVIEW.md`. The normal creator-report handoff carries the complete answer; no separate model-written growth summary is needed. Outside a review run, dated stock or standalone calculations keep the direct interface below.

## Evidence → choice → answer

For a public snapshot assessment, use top-level `schema_version`, `scope`, positive `horizon_days`, and `metrics` drawn from subscribers/followers/views/likes/comments. Only `platform` and `account` belong in `scope`; replace the example account with the snapshot's identity:

```json
{"schema_version":"growth-review.v1","scope":{"platform":"youtube","account":"creator"},"horizon_days":30,"metrics":["views"]}
```

Run:

```bash
cd '<run directory>' && KABO_STATIC_RUN_DIR='<run directory>' python3 '<skill directory>/scripts/estimate_growth.py' request.json --assess --snapshot snapshot.json --output growth_evidence.json
```

The script binds actual snapshot rows, groups formats, retains missingness/coverage and sample ages, and calculates the conditional median-performance scenario at captured publication pace for each supported content metric. It marks stock-growth inputs separately. These continuation assumptions come from the evidence; the user need not invent a publishing count. Select the relevant format and explain why its observed performance is a useful reference. All captured items are a transparent default, not proof of a representative or age-matched sample. If a narrower comparison is justified, use the direct method below and explain the selection.

In the answer, keep the number's measurement and deadline comparison together, so later turns can reuse the result without changing its meaning. For content scenarios, `estimate.time_basis` separates the publication window from the actual sampled content ages. Start with the supported comparison: the planned batch matching historical per-item performance at those ages. The deadline total itself is not identified: staggered publication dates give different ages on the deadline, and one cumulative snapshot supplies no age-performance trajectory. Its direction is `lower` when the samples' median observed age exceeds the publication window, since no item published inside the window can be older than the window at its end; say it is usually lower, without a number, probability or size of the gap. Otherwise the direction is `not_identified`; say it may be higher or lower. A follow-up about the deadline uses this field, not a new judgement. Dated trajectories and a publication schedule would support a separate deadline calculation.

If subscriber history is absent, ask for dated net gains; other requested metrics can still be answered. Correct unsupported earlier assistant numbers rather than adopting them as evidence. Targets may use historical performance with an explicit rationale, but neither a target nor user pressure supplies evidence for attainability or likelihood.
For dated stock records or an explicit user rate/count, calculate directly. `needs_input` identifies the minimum missing inputs. Do not translate a scenario into odds, manufacture a conversion rate, or add an uncomputed outcome range.

For a rough range, use the calculated sensitivity choices: the same captured cadence, with each new item's performance set to the observed lower quartile, median, or upper quartile. Explain the changed per-item assumption; these are neither the batch's predicted quantiles nor bounds covering a known probability. A prior assistant's uncalculated range is not another scenario. Keep subscriber/follower gaps separate rather than assigning conversion numbers to complete a table.

Direct calculation inputs use top-level `schema_version: growth-input.v1`, positive `horizon_days`, and `scope: {platform, account, metric, semantics}`. Each row carries the same scope and a `source` pointing to its persisted evidence or the supplied record. Timestamps include a timezone. Missing values are null, observed zero remains zero. Never mix accounts or metric definitions; window totals are not cumulative stock observations. Public totals do not measure private conversion.

Choose one method:

- `observed_pace`: for dated follower/subscriber or other cumulative stock observations. `scope.semantics` is `cumulative_stock`; `observations` contain `observed_at`, `value`, `source`, `scope`. The script uses first-to-last net change divided by actual elapsed days and exposes intermediate interval rates. Explain reversals or short/old windows before interpreting the unchanged-pace scenario; missing dates are not zero. Mock records are not real observations.
- `assumed_pace`: same observation fields, at least one dated baseline, plus `assumption: {amount, period: "day" | "week", origin: "user", quote}`. Use only an assumption explicitly supplied by the user. A cadence or scenario name is not a rate. Negative net change is allowed; linear values crossing zero are flagged.
- `content_scenario`: for views/likes/comments, with semantics `per_content_cumulative`. `samples` contain `content_id`, `published_at`, `observed_at`, `format`, `value`, `source`, `scope`. Supply `cohort: {format, age_min_days, age_max_days}` appropriate to the user's comparison; use the same account and keep the chosen age band visible. The script filters format and observation age, preserves missingness and multiplies the available sample median by a publication plan: `plan: {posts, origin: "user", quote, binding}` for an explicit total count; add `period: "day" | "week"` when `posts` is the user's count per period. Interpret the user's language into the source-bound contract below: the script derives the equivalent item count as `posts × horizon_days / period_days`. Keep a fractional equivalent count as a rate scenario, not a rounded calendar schedule. Or use `plan: {origin: "observed_cadence"}` with `--snapshot` to continue the captured pace. The latter derives `(captured same-format posts - 1) / elapsed publication days` from at least two dated posts; do not supply `_snapshot_cadence`. Report the actual observed ages returned by the script, not the broader selection band. This is a conditional total for new content at that observation age, not account-wide growth, a confidence interval or a guaranteed total by the plan's end. Do not use it for subscribers. A tiny or selective sample can be computed but needs that limitation in the interpretation.

Example dated input:

```json
{"schema_version":"growth-input.v1","mode":"observed_pace","scope":{"platform":"youtube","account":"creator","metric":"subscribers","semantics":"cumulative_stock"},"horizon_days":14,"observations":[{"scope":{"platform":"youtube","account":"creator","metric":"subscribers","semantics":"cumulative_stock"},"observed_at":"2026-10-01T00:00:00Z","value":37,"source":"user export row 1"},{"scope":{"platform":"youtube","account":"creator","metric":"subscribers","semantics":"cumulative_stock"},"observed_at":"2026-10-08T00:00:00Z","value":51,"source":"user export row 2"}]}
```

```bash
cd '<run directory>' && KABO_STATIC_RUN_DIR='<run directory>' python3 '<skill directory>/scripts/estimate_growth.py' growth_input.json --output growth_estimate.json
```

Use this skill's absolute script path from the run directory. A narrow estimate requires no synthesis or public handle. When public samples are needed, use the existing public review fetch contract; keep fetched facts in persisted artifacts and include their references in the calculation input. Do not claim that daily follower history or owner analytics are connected just because storage exists elsewhere in the platform. No tool of this Skill provides them: request a dated export rather than inventing a tool or substituting another creator's pace.

For `content_scenario` from the review's `public-content-snapshot.v1`, omit `samples` and add `--snapshot snapshot.json` to the command. The script binds the matching creator and metric directly, preserves unavailable values, and retains snapshot item references; do not retype those facts into samples. Keep the snapshot's coverage and source limitations in the interpretation. The native result is described by `references/growth_estimate.schema.json`.

For user inputs, pass `--question-file` pointing to the original request as plain text. Public review fetch retains it as `question.txt` in the printed run directory; use `--snapshot snapshot.json --question-file question.txt` there. For a publication plan, interpret the request's meaning first, then supply `quote` as the complete original request (excluding surrounding whitespace) and `binding`:

- Explicit total: `{"posts": 4, "origin": "user", "quote": "If I post 4 long videos in total next month, how many views will I get?", "binding": {"quantity_kind": "total", "quantity_quote": "4"}}`.
- Frequency: `{"posts": 3, "period": "week", "origin": "user", "quote": "3 videos por semana", "binding": {"quantity_kind": "cadence", "quantity_quote": "3", "period": "week", "period_quote": "por semana"}}`.

The model interprets total versus frequency and maps the user's language to `day`/`week`; the script does not claim to understand arbitrary prose. It checks that the whole request is retained, the numeric source matches `posts`, the period evidence occurs separately in the source, and the normalized fields agree. It then calculates the equivalent publication count without rounding. Do not invent evidence or turn a frequency into a model-calculated monthly total. Missing interpretation, truncated quotes, absent evidence or unsupported periods return `needs_input`; clarify when the request cannot be interpreted confidently. Structural consistency cannot prove that the model's semantic interpretation is correct. Read compatibility remains only for a complete old explicit-total short form such as `6 videos` (or `publish 6 videos`), not a number excerpted from arbitrary prose.

The new `binding` contract applies only to publication plans. `assumed_pace` retains its pre-existing stock-rate input reader for compatibility; it recognizes the existing Chinese/English forms rather than providing a new multilingual rate interface: `assumption.quote` is an exact source excerpt containing the signed net amount and day/week period, such as “20 subscribers per week” (a Chinese excerpt with a per-day or per-week net amount is read the same way). Never relabel an assistant suggestion as a user assumption. Relay computed values, formula, assumptions and missing inputs together; preserve the same limits under follow-up pressure.
