# This file ships to user machines, so it may not carry a list of supplier names: writing the
# vendors down here would publish exactly what the check exists to keep out of the report. The
# guard is therefore built from three things that are all knowable without such a list.

# 1. Field names of the pipeline's own lineage record. A Creator-facing report has no reason to
#    contain the words themselves.
STRUCTURAL_MARKERS = ("connector_id", "provider", "package_sha256", "source_commit")

# 2. Identifier *values* read out of the run's own documents. render_markdown() never projects any
#    of these keys, so one of their values appearing in the delivered Markdown means the semantic
#    step wrote it in by hand - which is how lineage escapes. Reading the value rather than pinning
#    a literal is what makes this survive a renamed or added source: it is covered the day it
#    appears in the run, not the day someone remembers to edit a constant.
#
#    `source_mode` is deliberately absent. Its values are the enum "public"/"owner", and "public" is
#    an ordinary word in a report about public content; banning it would fail valid deliveries.

)
# Short values are enum-like or collide with ordinary words; only opaque identifiers are banned.
MIN_IDENTIFIER_LEN = 8

# 3. Shapes that only a tool, a package, a digest or an off-evidence host has. The pre-rename
#    version of this tuple matched `<something>-connector` / `<something>-adapter`, which is dead
#    twice over: the connectors are keyed on capability labels now, and a capability label is the
#    one source word the report is *allowed* to use (the runner is told to answer "where did this
#    come from" with the label). These match what a leak actually looks like in prose instead.
