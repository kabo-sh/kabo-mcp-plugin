"""Run a complete public account review between its judgments, so the model only judges.

A complete public review needs the model for one decision: the single synthesis. Everything before
it is mechanical — resolve the account, page its public history under the sample rules, place each
response, decide which coverage flags the Snapshot may carry, assemble, analyze, and print the
compact synthesis input — and so is everything after it: compose, both validators, the report.
Measured 2026-09-18 on Instagram reviews: 14 model requests for a small account and 21 for one
that paged four times, almost all of them that plumbing, and one of them a placement repaired by
hand after a new run directory had been reserved mid-run.

    fetch  --platform P --handle H     resolve -> history pages -> Snapshot -> Analyzer -> synthesis input
    fetch  --platform youtube --channel-id UC…   the same, from a channel id
    report                              Compose -> validate_artifacts -> validate_creator_report -> report

Retrieval is one backend call, `collect_account_history`, printed as a single `call:` line for the
model to make (`connector_driver.py`); its parameters carry the sample rules in
`references/complete-review.md`. Instagram: `resolve_profile`, then the first `list_posts` and
`list_reels` pages together; after that one page at a time from the format with fewer rows until the
combined count reaches 100. YouTube: `get_channel`, `list_channel_uploads` with 50 results and at most
one cursor follow-up. TikTok: `list_account_posts` once with `limit: 100`. The same command run again
with `--placed` places each call's response as `snapshot/envelope-NN.json` in fetch order, byte for
byte from the copy `static_host.py fetch` (or `stage`) saved when it split the composite result.
