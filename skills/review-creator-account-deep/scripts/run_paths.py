"""Find a file this Skill's steps name, wherever the run directory actually keeps it.

Every step here starts from `account_analysis.json`, which `review-creator-account` leaves in the
run directory. The steps name it relatively, and a model that types one wrong prefix gets a bare
"no such file" — then goes looking. Observed 2026-09-22 on @vinny_creative: the command ran with
`output/account_analysis.json`, failed, and the run answered by searching the tree with `rg`; the
one turn that followed carried 2.4 MB of shell output and the request came back 413 Payload Too
Large, after ten videos had already been watched. Locating the file is settled work, so it stops
being the model's to get right.

Resolution never leaves this run: only the run directory and the few folders it reserves.
