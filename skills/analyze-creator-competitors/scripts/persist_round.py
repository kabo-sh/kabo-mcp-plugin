"""Place this run's profile and account-history Envelopes by whose they are, not by call order.

`persist_many.py` binds each response to a file by position: the n-th `--dest` takes the n-th
unplaced response. That leaves two things to the model — typing every target in the right order,
and never letting a stray response into the queue — and on 2026-09-18 an Instagram competitor
run got both wrong. One command named two operations, placed nothing, and the recovery refetched
the subject's Reels; the spare copy then took the first competitor's slot, every later page slid
one account down, and the model spent a chain of six `mv` putting them back. About 45 s, and had
it not noticed, the report would have credited one account's Reels to another.

Here nobody names a target. Each response says whose it is:

  resolve_profile        data.profile.username
  get_channel            rows[0].id (matched) / custom_url (file label)
  list_channel_uploads   data.channel.id (matched) / custom_url (file label)
  list_reels, list_posts the one account present in *every* row, as poster or co-author

The last rule is the careful one. A feed is mostly the account's own posts, but collaborations
are recorded under whoever started them, so "most frequent poster" names the wrong account: on
that same run one page was 7/12 another brand's, and a majority vote filed it under that brand.
The owner is instead the account that appears in each row one way or the other — on the 2026-09-18
pages that rule named every non-empty page correctly and refused none. When no single account
spans every row it refuses rather than guesses.

The accounts this round may place are the discovery roster — `selected_handles` then
`reserve_handles` from `competitor-discovery-selection.json`. A response whose owner is outside it
(a duplicate of the subject's own history, say) is reported and left unplaced, which is exactly
the copy that caused the slide above. An empty page carries no rows to read an owner from; it
goes, in fetch order, to the roster accounts that no readable page of that operation claimed.
Two empty pages swapped between two accounts still say the same thing about both.
