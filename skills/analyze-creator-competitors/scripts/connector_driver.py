"""The mechanical half of a skill driver: hand calls over, place, run scripts.

A skill's `drive.py` runs everything between two model judgments — which data call follows, where
each response is placed, which deterministic script runs next — and prints only what the next
judgment reads. This module is the part of that which does not depend on the skill: fetch rounds
recorded by what they asked for, the hand-over of each round's calls to the model (`call:` lines
naming public MCP tools; `--placed` picks the staged responses up), one more hand-over of a round
the data service briefly failed, the run directory, the stage lock and the stage state file.

This package makes no data calls itself (`fetch` always raises `NoOutbox`), so every round is
handed over: the model makes the printed calls, stages each complete result with
`static_host.py stage`, and runs the stage again with `--placed`.

Where a stage runs. The first stage of a run (`start`, or `fetch`) works in the run directory that
`static_host.py init` reserved (`KABO_STATIC_RUN_DIR`). Every later stage runs only from inside the
run directory: from anywhere else — this skill's own directory above all — it stops before writing
anything and names the directory to `cd` into. One stage at a time holds a run directory
(`.drive.lock`), and the state file is replaced whole, never rewritten in place.
