"""Run everything between two judgments of a competitor run, so the model only judges.

A competitor run needs the model for five decisions: which public identity is the subject, how the
Request and discovery intents are frozen, the discovery Gate scores, the eligibility relationships,
and the synthesis. Everything between them is mechanical — which connector call follows, with which
parameters, where each response is placed, which projection is printed next. Measured 2026-09-18 on
an Instagram run: 22 model requests, of which 15 did nothing but that plumbing, at 6 s of fixed cost
each plus whatever the model typed; and every mistake in that plumbing (a positional placement one
slot off, a wrong `--at` form, a repeated `--operation`) cost a further round trip to repair.

Each stage below starts right after one judgment and stops right before the next one: it makes the
connector calls the judgment implies, places every response with the same placement scripts the
manual workflow uses — so the files on disk are the ones those scripts always wrote — runs the
deterministic steps, and prints exactly what the next judgment reads.

    start     --platform P [--query N]   identity search            -> subject candidates
    start     --platform instagram --post URL   seed post + its author's subject stage
    subject   --handle H | --channel-id  subject profile + history  -> caption phrases, schemas
    discover                             collect + profile search   -> Gate author table
    select                               Gate -> roster -> profiles -> eligibility projection
    content                              finalize -> pages -> Assemble/Analyze -> synthesis input
    comments                             comment targets -> list_comments -> audience comments
    report                               Compose -> Validate -> Render

A stage makes no data calls itself: it prints the calls as public MCP tool names (`call:` lines)
for the model to make and stops; the model stages each complete result with `static_host.py
stage`, and the same stage run again with `--placed` picks those responses up.

The hand-over, the retry of a briefly failed round, the run directory, the stage lock and the state
file are `connector_driver.py`, the same file every other driver package ships.
