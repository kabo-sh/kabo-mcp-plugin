"""Run everything between two judgments of a competitor run, so the model only judges.

A competitor run needs the model for five decisions: which public identity is the subject, how the
Request and discovery intents are frozen, the discovery Gate scores, the eligibility relationships,
and the synthesis. Everything between them is mechanical — which connector call follows, with which
parameters, where each response is placed, which projection is printed next. Measured 2026-09-18 on
an Instagram run: 22 model requests, of which 15 did nothing but that plumbing, at 6 s of fixed cost
each plus whatever the model typed; and every mistake in that plumbing (a positional placement one
slot off, a wrong `--at` form, a repeated `--operation`) cost a further round trip to repair.

Each stage below starts right after one judgment and stops right before the next one: it makes the
connector calls the judgment implies, places every response with the same placement scripts the
manual workflow uses — so the files on disk are the ones those scripts always wrote — runs the
deterministic steps, and prints exactly what the next judgment reads.

    start     --platform P [--query N]   identity search            -> subject candidates
    start     --platform instagram --post URL   seed post + its author's subject stage
    subject   --handle H | --channel-id | --platform youtube --handle @H   subject profile + history  -> caption phrases, schemas
              (an Instagram handle that does not resolve comes back with account-search candidates: a stop to ask the user)
    discover                             collect + profile search   -> Gate author table
    select                               Gate -> roster -> profiles -> eligibility projection
    content [--comments]                 finalize -> pages -> Assemble/Analyze -> synthesis input
                                         (--comments: comment targets -> list_comments -> audience comments)
    comments                             the same comment block alone, after content (kept as an alias)
    report                               Compose -> Validate -> Render

A stage makes no data calls itself: it prints the calls as public MCP tool names (`call:` lines)
for the model to make and stops; the model saves each complete result to the file named under it,
and the same stage run again with `--placed` fetches (or stages) those files and picks them up.

The hand-over, the retry of a briefly failed round, the run directory, the stage lock and the state
file are `connector_driver.py`, the same file every other driver package ships.

Two options save host round trips without changing what is fetched or judged. `--workspace W` on a
first stage (`start`, `subject`) reserves the run directory itself when none is reserved yet, so the
run needs no separate `static_host.py init` command. `--result <tool>=<file>` on any stage takes a
saved result from another file the same way (implies `--placed`); the printed resume needs none.
