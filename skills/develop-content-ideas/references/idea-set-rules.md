# IdeaSet contract rules

Read this whole before writing `idea_set.json`. These rules apply on top of
`idea-set.schema.json`; the validator enforces many of them, not all.

## Choosing task_intent

Choose `capacity_plan` only when a positive total-time budget and nonempty `available_assets` are
explicitly supplied or evidenced. A time budget alone does not establish available equipment or
props. For a brief-only topic shortlist with unknown assets, use `task_intent="brief_only"`; with
upstream evidence use `open_shortlist`. Preserve all stated time/cost limits under
`production_constraints` (status `partial` when some constraints are supplied), keep
`available_assets=[]`, and treat feasibility as conditional. When no production constraints are
supplied, use `status="absent"`, null scalar fields and empty assets; a feasible topic or template
request does not require inventing a time limit or asking the creator to supply one for the schema.
If the user specifically requires a confirmed capacity plan, ask for the missing
assets rather than silently downgrading that deliverable.

## Rules

- For a new-account first batch, use `overview.portfolio_logic` to explain the proposed audience
  and positioning, the order in which the ideas establish that promise, and what audience feedback
  would determine the next batch. Mark an unstated audience segment as a proposal. Give a usable
  first-batch content plan without requiring account history, production assets or
  posting-frequency decisions before choosing topics. Do not replace this plan with an
  unprioritized list or invent an algorithmic cadence. The concise renderer carries this field.
- `open_shortlist`, `brief_only`, and `capacity_plan` support 1–20 ideas. Preserve the explicit
  requested count in the request, IdeaSet and report; never truncate it to a smaller default.
  Larger supported batches use the same two-pass generation budget and evidence/production gates.
- For reusable sentence patterns, keep the fill-in slots in `working_title` and include each
  requested fully filled example in that candidate's `making_direction`, clearly labelled as an
  illustration. This field reaches the Creator-facing report; an example only in audit fields or
  an instruction telling the user to supply their own example does not fulfill the request.
- `capacity_plan`: requires declared available assets and a positive total-time budget. Record an
  estimated-minute range and assets used for every idea; the sum of maximum minutes must fit the
  declared total budget. Preserve explicit time limits for other intents too: provide conditional
  estimates fitting the budget, and disclose any unconfirmed production assumptions.
- `rework_content`: a VideoAnalysis may be used with or without Trend/Competitor context. Generate
  one target idea with the requested number of Hook options, all tied to the same analyzed content.
- `brief_only`: require a literal `generation_basis.direct_topic` or a bound prior IdeaSet/chat
  reference as the continuation rules define. Allow empty evidence arrays, mark Creator fit as
  hypothesis or unassessed, and make no external factual claims.
- A request for account performance, trends, competitors, Creator context, or a specific video
  cannot silently become a brief-only request. If the required evidence is missing and fallback was
  not explicitly authorized, return the missing-source block without ideas.
- Set `evidence_basis` on every idea: `source_backed` only when upstream/context refs and evidence
  refs are present; use `brief_based` or `hypothesis` when the idea is derived from a brief or an
  unverified inference. Never invent metrics to satisfy a schema.
- For `open_shortlist`, `capacity_plan`, and `brief_only`, `hook_option_count=1` requires
  `hook_preview.progressive_line=null`; count `2` requires a nonempty progressive line adding
  information rather than repeating the opening. Keep `hook_options=[]` for these intents. For
  `rework_content`, preserve the requested options and make `hook_preview` mirror the first option.
- `primary_evidence_ref`, when present, must belong to that idea's `evidence_refs`.
- For each idea, `production_feasibility.assets_used` contains only exact names from the request's
  `available_assets`; unknown resources mean `assets_used=[]`. A shortlist can still offer concrete
  filming directions by naming future needs in `required_assets`, setting
  **`production_feasibility.status="requires_user_confirmation"`**, and writing the conditions in
  `production_feasibility.assumptions` and `gates.production_missing`. Include
  `answer_production_question` in `interaction.next_actions`, alongside `choose`. The status is an
  enum value, not a separate flag; an assumption alone does not set it. Reuse exact available-asset
  names when already evidenced. Do not claim equipment, footage or permission from a job title,
  erase real requirements or invent availability to make validation pass. Pending needs do not
  block selecting topics, and the report must retain them. Capacity/rework and exclusions stay strict.
- Keep `platforms` within `platform_targets`, reject excluded formats/assets, and use `why_now` as
  an evidence-backed claim only when a dated source supports it; otherwise say that timeliness is
  unverified.
- Apply hard filters first (exclusions, missing required source, impossible production budget),
  then rank Creator fit, evidence strength, differentiation, timeliness, and production feasibility
  with stable rank/title tie-breakers. `selection_status` remains `candidate` until the user
  selects an idea. For variants of one selected example, the fixed scaffold and mechanism are
  required similarities. Assess distinctness and differentiation only in the permitted variable
  slots and their consequences; a change of mechanism is a mismatch, not a higher novelty score.
- Large supported counts must be prepared as supported batches in the same core generation budget;
  do not split a batch request into hidden sub-tasks to bypass the two-call target.
