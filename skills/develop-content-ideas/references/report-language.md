# Report language and display translations

Read this whole before writing `idea_set.json`.

## Choosing the language

Set `report_language` on both IdeaRequest and IdeaSet to the language requested for the final
report and interaction (BCP 47 tag). This is separate from `language_targets`, which describes the
creative content. Infer the report language from the current user request unless explicitly
specified earlier; preserve quotations, titles and supplied creative text verbatim. Generate all
explanatory fields, questions and rationale in that report language, so the whole report reads in
the user's language. The renderer and validator share the locale contract, including missing-input
and selection actions.

Chinese omission is supported only for legacy requests; new non-Chinese requests must set the
field. The shipped UI catalogs support zh/en/fr/ar and regional variants. For any unsupported
language, report the missing locale support explicitly; do not generate a report silently in
Chinese or another language.

## `evidence_gap_translations`

For every explicit `report_language` (including Chinese), retain original
`evidence_summary.data_gaps` for provenance and supply an `evidence_gap_translations` entry
(`source_text`, `report_text`) for every gap. When the source already matches the report language,
explicitly repeat it as `report_text`; otherwise translate every substantive constraint, including
whether it describes the old source or the current run, without softening a limitation. Missing
mappings fail validation rather than leaking the source language. The renderer and validator
project these entries natively. These projections never alter user-supplied creative text or
canonical evidence identifiers.

In that same `evidence_gap_translations` array, also supply one entry for each distinct canonical
value actually displayed: `status`, `task_intent`, `source_mode`, non-`unknown` effort when no
minute estimate is present, and each nonempty `primary_evidence_ref`. Translate these values for
presentation only; never edit the canonical enums, evidence IDs or lineage.

The array is one strict union of actual source gaps and these finite displayed values: unknown,
duplicate or missing mappings fail validation. A source present in both sets has exactly one entry.
Do not add a new output field or turn a display value into a source gap. When source text already
matches the report language, repeat it explicitly. The renderer projects only real source gaps into
the gap section and only the finite canonical values into their display positions, never into
creative copy or raw audit lineage.

Keep the existing IdeaSet schema unchanged so downstream consumers can read the artifact. Legacy
Chinese IdeaSets without `report_language` retain their old projection; old explicit-locale
IdeaSets require these mappings when explicitly revalidated by this version. This does not rewrite
prior reports or change request/upstream inputs. Review translation meaning and the final report:
coverage validation cannot prove translation semantics.
