"""Run everything between two judgments of a TikTok competitor run, so the model only judges.

A TikTok competitor run needs the model for three decisions: the frozen Request and query plan
(with the search region), the discovery Gate, and the synthesis. Everything between them is
mechanical — which connector call follows, with which parameters, where each response is placed,
which script runs next. Measured 2026-09-18 on two runs of this skill: 26 and 29 model requests,
most of which did nothing but that plumbing (a catalog read, one request per search, a separate
placement command, a separate comment-target command).

Each stage below starts right after one judgment and stops right before the next one: it makes the
connector calls the judgment implies, places every response into the same bundle files, at the
same positions, as the manual workflow did — so every later script reads exactly what it always
read — runs the deterministic steps, and prints exactly what the next judgment reads.

    start                  reserve the run directory     -> Request and query-plan schemas
    discover --region R    4 searches -> candidate set   -> discovery projection + Gate schema
    content [--comments]   selection -> 5 histories -> Snapshot -> analysis -> synthesis evidence
    comments               comment targets -> list_comments -> audience comments
    report                 Compose -> Validate -> Render -> the Creator report

A stage makes no data calls itself (connector_driver.py): it prints the calls as public MCP tool
names for the model to make in one response; the same stage run again with `--placed` picks the
staged responses up.
